<h1>Directory Structure</h1>

<p>The directory to be processed must contain a directory named
<code>content</code> and a directory named <code>templates</code>. SSG
builds your website in a directory named <code>public</code> which
will be found alongside these two directories. Orphaned files from
previous SSG runs are not deleted from <code>public</code>; if you
wish to clean up these orphans, just delete <code>public</code> and
SSG will create it afresh on the next run.</p>

<p>Apart from files with the suffix <code>.page</code> and directories
containing a file named <code>.ignore</code>, the contents of
<code>content</code> are copied wholesale to <code>public</code>,
including most file metadata â€” the <code>content</code> directory is
effectively a template for the entire website, with <code>.page</code>
files used as placeholders. Thus <code>content</code> should be
structured exactly as you wish your final website to be structured,
anticipating that <code>.page</code> files will be replaced with
processed files.</p>

<p>You can structure the <code>templates</code> directory however you
like. The templates are referenced as relative paths from this
directory.</p>

<p><code>content</code>, <code>templates</code>, <code>.ignore</code>
and the <code>.page</code> suffix constitute pretty much all the magic
filenames that SSG uses. The only addition is
that <code>index.page</code> has a default weight of <code>None</code>
(see <a href="page_files.html">Page Files</a>).</p>
