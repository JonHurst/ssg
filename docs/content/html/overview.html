<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>SSG is
a <a href="https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/04/14/what-is-a-static-site-generator-and-3-ways-to-find-the-best-one/?utm_source=jamstackorg&utm_medium=what-are-ssg-pnh&utm_campaign=devex">static
site generator</a> that leverages the
excellent <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Jinja
templating engine</a>, the expressiveness of
the <a href="https://toml.io/en/">TOML file format</a> and the
batteries included power
of <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html">Python&apos;s
standard library</a> to create a static website from a simple file
hierarchy of source material.</p>

<p>Its modus operandi is loosely based on that of
<a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a>, which, itself, works a
lot like one of the most commonly used static site
generators, <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>. SSG is a great deal
simpler than either of them, though. In particular, much less stuff
gets done implicitly. Whether this is a desirable trait is very much
dependent on your use case.</p>
