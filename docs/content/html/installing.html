<h2>Install</h2>
    
<p>The <code>ssg.py</code> application is packaged as a Python
  "zipapp" using a tool called "shiv", which was released to the open
  source community by developers at LinkedIn. If you want to see the
  code, you can just unzip the application file.</p>

<p>Zipapps are deployed in a similar manner to standalone binary
  executables, with the proviso that a suitable Python interpreter
  must be available on the system. There is no installation required;
  you can run them from anywhere. If, however, you place the zipapp in
  a location referenced by your <code>PATH</code> environmental
  variable, you can run it from any directory, which is very
  convenient.</p>

<p>You can also rename the file and it will still work; you will still
  need to have the <code>.py</code> suffix on Windows, though.</p>

<h2>Uninstall</h2>


<p>If you no longer want SSG just delete the file. The only
  modification that is made to your file system is
  a <code>.shiv</code> directory in your home directory that is used
  to cache the decompressed files. Feel free to delete this with
  impunity; it will be recreated next time SSG is run at the cost of a
  small amount of startup delay.</p>
