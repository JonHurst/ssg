<h1>Quick Mode</h1>

<p>To render in quick mode, add the command line
  option <code>--quick</code>.

<p>Quick mode dramatically speeds up rendering by making a pretty
  heroic assumption: the target of a <code>.page</code> file is up to
  date if the timestamp of the <code>.page</code> file and the
  timestamps of all the files referenced in its <code>[content]</code>
  table are less than the timestamp of the target.</p>

<p>Since SSG makes the data associated with all pages available to the
  template of every page and any change to the templates themselves
  can affect any page, this is certainly not a generally valid
  assumption. For many editing tasks, however, it is possible, knowing
  how the content is structured, to determine that the assumption is
  actually valid and thus take advantage of the faster rendering.</p>

<p>For smaller sites, where a full rendering often costs well under a
  hundred milliseconds, quick mode is probably not worth the effort.
  For very large sites, however, the quick rendering may be worth the
  added complexity for appropriate editing tasks.</p>
