<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<h2>Python interpreter</h2>

<p>A Python interpreter with version 3.11 or newer must be installed. To
obtain a copy:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Linux<dd>
    <p>Linux users will almost certainly have a suitable Python
    interpreter pre-installed. If not, refer to your
    distribution&apos;s documentation.</p>
  <dt>Windows<dd>
    <p>Windows users can install the latest Python interpreter from
    the Microsoft store.</p>
  <dt>Mac<dd>
    <p>Mac users can download an installer
    from <a href="https://python.org">python.org</a>.
</dl>

<h2>Knowledge of Jinja templates</h2>

<p>All the heavy lifting is done
by <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">the Jinja
templating engine</a>. SSG just wrangles data that has been declared
within a hierarchy of files and presents it as the context for Jinja.
The more you know about Jinja, the more you can do with SSG.</p>

<h2>Knowledge of TOML</h2>

<p>What isn't done by Jinja is <a href="https://toml.io/en/">largely
done by TOML</a>. TOML is used to link templates with output pages,
control how pages relate to one another and provide a repository for
free-form data that can be supplied as context for the templates. The
better your understanding of TOML, the more sense SSG will make.</p>
