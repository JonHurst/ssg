<h1>Quick Start</h1>

<h2>Starter Site</h2>

<p>Once you have your <a href="prerequisites.html"> Python interpreter
  set up</a>, the easiest way to get started is
  to <a href="downloads/starter.zip">download the starter site zip
  file</a> and unzip it in a convenient location. The zip file
  contains both a copy of the application file (<code> ssg.py
  </code>) and a pre-populated file hierarchy that SSG can use to
  create a simple example website. It should hopefully be fairly
  obvious how this file hierarchy can be adapted to your needs.</p>

<h2>Building the starter site</h2>

<h3>Linux/MacOS</h3>
<p>Open a terminal and navigate to the <code>site</code> directory
  where you unzipped the downloaded file. You should see
  the <code>ssg.py</code> file. Run this by typing:</p>

  <pre class="code">
./ssg.py</pre>

<h3>Windows</h3>

<p>Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the directory where you
  unzipped the stater site. Double click the <code>ssg.bat</code> file
  that you find there.</p>

<p>Alternatively, open the Command Prompt app and navigate to the
  directory. You should see the <code>ssg.py</code> file. Run this by
  typing:</p>
  <pre class="code">ssg.py</pre>

<p>Note that double clicking on the <code>ssg.py</code> in Windows
  Explorer won't work because Windows Explorer does not set the
  current working directory to the directory containing the file that
  is double clicked.</p>
